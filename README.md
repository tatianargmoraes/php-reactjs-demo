## About This Project
This is a basic web app demo that uses ReactJS for the frontend and PHP for the backend.

It should also include a login mechanism that will authenticate the user through the Google Auth API.

The current code is the basic PHP/ReactJS boilerplate plus some sketches on the login/auth part. The whole code is currently a work in progress.
